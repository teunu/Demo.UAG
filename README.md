# Untitled Adventure Game | Demo
This repository is home to open sourced demo "Untitled Adventure Game". 
This project was worked on as a challenge allowing me 16 hours in one week to redo and port <a href="https://teunu.com/uag">an old js web project</a> into Unity. All work was done by me in those 16 hours, including sprite work, programming, animation, and sound. This is barring the excellent music "The Leap" created by Denis Borodin for this project.

You can download <a href="https://github.com/teunu/Demo.UAG/releases/tag/VD1.0">The Demo</a> and each version's source code from given page.

## Sharing
I've commited to sharing this project and its source code as aid to understanding workflow and architecture. I use this regarding students, clients, and potential employers. Besides it's intent as showcase material, I invite everyone to freely explore for their own studies and goals. For this reason, it has the MIT liscence.

## Future Additions
Any additions I make to this project will be tracked as well as the time spend, and reflected in the changelog. I hope that the addition of time spend sets further example of the efficacy of the workflows and patterns I use in my work.
